# Ignitia
An Agentic AI System for Reflection, Insight, and Action

Ignitia is an agentic AI application designed to transform unstructured human reflection into structured insight and practical next steps. Unlike traditional journaling or chatbot systems, Ignitia uses multiple specialized agents that collaborate to listen, analyze, reason, and plan—mirroring how a thoughtful human mentor operates.

The system is built to demonstrate how agent-based AI can be applied to real human problems such as decision fatigue, lack of clarity, and inconsistent self-reflection.
